# SpaceEco System - ISS Waste Management

A smart system designed to manage, track, and recycle waste on the International Space Station (ISS).

## 📝 Project Overview
This project was developed as part of the Information Systems B.Sc. program at **The Academic College of Tel-Aviv, Yaffo**. The system provides astronauts with a digital interface to log waste data in zero-gravity conditions, monitor real-time bin capacities, and access NASA-standard safety protocols for hazardous materials.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Real-Time Dashboard:** Monitor waste levels and bin capacities via a dynamic tracking interface.
* **Data Validation:** Integrated client-side validation using **JavaScript** to ensure accurate logging of weight and material types.
* **Server-Side Processing:** Secure data handling and storage using **PHP** and **MySQL**.
* **Learning Hub:** Interactive training modules featuring audio briefings and video demonstrations for debris containment.
* **Database Management:** Ability to view entries or clear the entire waste history.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6), jQuery, Bootstrap 5.
* **Backend:** PHP.
* **Database:** MySQL.
* **Media:** Video (MP4) and Audio (WAV) modules.



## 📂 Project Structure
The code is organized into a modular directory structure:
* `/CSS` - Stylesheets and UI design.
* `/JS` - Client-side logic and form validation.
* `/Includes` - Core application pages (HTML/PHP) and processing scripts.
* `/Images`, `/gift`, `/Audio` - Media assets and visual resources.
* `index.html` - The main entry point of the system.

## 👤 Persona & Scenarios
* **Persona:** **Alex**, an astronaut and maintenance officer aboard the ISS.
* **Scenario 1 (Learning & Reporting):** Alex accesses the Learning Hub to review safety protocols before logging new waste data.
* **Scenario 2 (Monitoring & Analysis):** Alex reviews waste categories and checks current bin capacities on the Tracking Dashboard.
